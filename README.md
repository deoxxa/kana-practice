Kana Practice
=============

Overview
--------

This is a simple game designed to help you practice your hiragana memorisation!
Hooray! The game consists of matching kana to their syllabic equal, choosing
from a board of 16 options. It keeps a record of your score and tries to show
you the kana that you need to work on most more often.

It was designed to be easy to use on full size and portable devices alike, and
to be easy to start using.

------------

1. A decent browser (with Japanese fonts installed!)
2. Ender (http://ender.no.de/)

------------
